# Ameos Filemanager

## What does it do?

This extension allow users to handle documents in the frontend context. You can set up read and write rights according to frontend groups. Filemanager uses FAL, that way, you'll be sure to have a similarity between what's in the frontend context and the filelist in the BE. There is also a search plugin available to search a special file. An export plugin is also available. It'll export how many time each file has been downloaded. Please consult the User manual for additional information.

## Idea for future features

* Versionning
* Url rewriting
* Virtual file (youtube, vimeo, ...)
