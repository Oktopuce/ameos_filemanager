Compatibility with older version
=================================

If you update ameos_filamanger from a version < 1.2.x, you can reactivate older plugin in the extension manager.

There 4 old plugins :

 - Filemanager : old filemanager explorer. Configuration is nearly same as current explorer
 - Filemanager > Flat : display all files from a folder, included subfolder's file
 - Filemanager > Export : Export downloaded file. Actually replace by a backend module
 - Filemanager > Search : display a search field. Include by default in the current explorer

You can activate ajax mode in old filemanager explorer by adding typoscript static templates "File manager > Ajax".
